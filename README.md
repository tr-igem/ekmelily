Ekmelily
========

Ekmelily is an extension for [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/)
that supports variable accidentals and key signatures
for the notation of microtonal music in several tunings.

It introduces predefined and custom notation styles,
and defines own note names based on the names for semi- and quarter-tones
given in LilyPond.

Ekmelily requires LilyPond version 2.24 or higher.
