Ekmelily
========

Ekmelily is an extension for [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) that supports variable
accidentals and key signatures for the notation of microtonal music
in several equal-temperament tunings - 12, 19, 24, 31, 36, 48, 53, 72, 96-EDO -
and in 5-limit JI.
For this purpose, it introduces predefined and user-defined notation styles.
Each style describes a set of symbols for the alterations up to the five-quarters-tone, at most.
Furthermore, Ekmelily defines own note names based on the names for
semi- and quarter-tones given in LilyPond.

Ekmelily requires LilyPond version 2.19.22 or higher.
