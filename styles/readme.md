Ekmelily Notation Styles
========================

This is a collection of files "TUNING/style-NOTATION.pdf" which demonstrate
notation styles in the available tunings of Ekmelily. Each file includes:

*   A list of all accidental symbols used in the notation style,
    together with the represented tone fraction,
    its SMuFL code point U+..., and its glyph name,
    except for the universal notation styles `alteration` and `step`.

*   The usage in a [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) input file.

*   Some sample notes with their note names (usually "nederlands" and
    "english") and the tone fractions.

The accidental symbols are from [Ekmelos](https://github.com/tr-igem/ekmelos).

Note: The LilyPond input files "TUNING/style.ly" require "styledefs.ily"
as well as "ly/ekmelos-map.ily" from Ekmelos.
